# Modular System Configuration

Welcome to the Modular System Configuration project! This repository houses the implementation of a dynamic programming approach for optimizing backward compatibility in system configurations.

## Overview

Modularization is a key strategy in product design and system configuration, enabling efficient mass customization and reducing development cycles. This project focuses on enhancing the efficiency and compatibility of modular systems through dynamic programming techniques.

## Features

- Efficient optimization of system configurations
- Consideration of backward compatibility for seamless integration
- Streamlined collaboration and concurrent engineering practices
- Reduction of costs and resource wastage

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ehvenga/dynamic.programming.approach.to.backward.compatablity-django.git`

## Data Set

1. Optimality Test Data: Datasets to assess the algorithm's solution optimality.
2. Scalability Test Data: Datasets for evaluating the algorithm's performance with larger-scale problems.
